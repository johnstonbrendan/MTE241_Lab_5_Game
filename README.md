# MTE241_Lab_5_Game
Created a 2D Platformer with a twist to be run on the Kiel Development Boards. 
The game consisted of the player, enemies, portals and a target enemy. 
The goal of the game was to catch the target enemy while avoiding contact with other enemies. 
The twist was that time for the enemies was frozen, so you could change time for the enemies if you wanted to move them, 
however the player could move freely. 2 Puzzles were created to demonstrate the game dynamics.
